<p><strong>Access to personal data:</strong> In some jurisdictions, you have the right
to request access to personal data about you. In these cases, we will
comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions,
including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to
you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about
your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may

Otherwise, requests to exercise your applicable rights regarding your
personal data may be made to: <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a> . Please note

invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable
law.</p>

<p><strong>Portability:</strong> In some jurisdictions, you have the right to ask for a

<h4 id="do-not-track">Do Not Track</h4>

<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that
signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online
activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a
particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block
that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s
user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet
uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including this picoCTF
website, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>

<p>The Services are intended to be used by individuals who are at least 13
years old. Consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act, if we learn that we received any
information directly from a child under age 13 without his or her
parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform
the child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot
use the Services.</p>

<p><em>California Minors:</em> If you are a California resident who is under age
18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have
submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at:
<a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you
want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL
for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it.
We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1)
federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was
not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified;
(4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting
removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for
providing the Content or information. Removal of your content or
information from the Services does not ensure complete or comprehensive
removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems
of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or
information posted by you; our obligations under California law are
satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render
it invisible to other users and the public.</p>
