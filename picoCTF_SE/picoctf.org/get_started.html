                                                working very hard to protect people and to make technology easier

                                                hacking in the news, the story is about people using hacking to do
                                                harm, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Career-wise,
                                                people skilled in hacking are highly sought out by companies looking
                                                to strengthen their cybersecurity. Computer security experts are in
                                                very high demand today, and often are paid six-figure salaries.</p>

                                            <p>CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security
                                                competition. Contestants are presented with a set of
                                                challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling)
                                                skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually
                                                cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string
                                                (called a flag) which is submitted to an online
                                                scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of

                                                   target="_blank">US Cyber Challenge</a>. These competitions focus
                                                primarily on systems administration
                                                fundamentals, which are very useful and marketable skills. However,
                                                we believe the proper purpose of a high school
                                                computer security competition is not only to teach valuable skills,
                                                but also to get students interested in and
                                                excited about computer science. Defensive competitions are often
                                                laborious affairs, and come down to running checklists
                                                and executing config scripts. Offense, on the other hand, is heavily
                                                focused on exploration and improvisation, and
                                                often has elements of play. We believe a competition touching on the
                                                offensive elements of computer security is
                                                therefore a better vehicle for ‘tech evangelism’ to students in
                                                American high schools. Further, we believe that an
                                                understanding of offensive techniques is essential for mounting an
                                                effective defense, and that the
                                                tools-and-configuration focus encountered in defensive competitions
                                                does not lead students to ‘know their enemy’ as
                                                effectively as teaching them to actively think like an attacker.</p>

                                            <p>picoCTF is an offensively-oriented highschool computer security
                                                competition that seeks to generate interest in computer
                                                science among highschoolers: teaching them enough about computer
                                                security to pique their curiosity, motivating them to
                                                explore on their own, and enabling them to better defend their
                                                machines.</p>

                                            <p>The name of the competition follows the Plaid Parliament of Pwning’s
                                                running tradition of using the letter P wherever possible.</p>
